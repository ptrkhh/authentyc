# Authentyc.AI Landing Page Plan
## Strategy A: Multi-Persona Testing Page

**Date**: 2025-11-21
**Goal**: Test demand across multiple categories (dating, hiring, founder matching), collect qualified waitlist signups, identify strongest segment for Phase 1 launch
**Timeline**: Build in 2-3 days, launch within 1 week
**Success Metric**: 100+ waitlist signups in Month 1, 300+ by Month 3, clear category winner (>40% of signups)

---

## Strategic Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Identify strongest category** across hiring, dating, and founder matching (>40% threshold)
2. **Validate demand** with qualified leads (email + use case + AI history)
3. **Test messaging** to see which value propositions resonate
4. **Build early adopter community** for validation phase

### Secondary Goals
5. **A/B test different positioning** (authenticity vs. capability vs. compatibility)
6. **Gauge willingness to pay** (via survey question, not blocking signup)
7. **Identify early adopters** for validation study recruitment
8. **Create shareable content** for Product Hunt, HN, Twitter

### Success Metrics (Conservative Approach)
- **Week 1**: 50 signups (mostly from personal network)
- **Month 1**: 100+ signups with 50%+ open rate on follow-up email
- **Month 3**: 300+ signups with clear category winner (>40% of signups)
- **Month 6**: 500+ active users in winning category
- **Conversion rate target**: 3-5% of visitors → waitlist signup (conservative)

### Section 1: Hero / Above the Fold

**Layout**: Full-width, centered, minimal

│     Joining 100+ people on the waitlist • Launching Q1 2026│
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Copy Notes:**
- **Headline**: "Stop guessing. Start knowing." → Clear benefit, creates curiosity
- **Subheadline**: Sets up the problem (uncertainty in relationships/hiring)
- **Body**: Introduces solution without technical jargon
- **Social proof**: Start with "100+" and update as it grows (be honest, not aspirational)
- **CTA**: "Get Early Access" not "Join Waitlist" (sounds more exclusive)
- **Launch date**: Q1 2026 (we're in Q4 2025 now)

**Visual Elements:**
- Clean, modern design (think Linear, Notion, Stripe)
- Subtle gradient or illustration showing "authentic self vs. curated self"
- Optional: Short looping video/animation of conversation → insights extraction

and create your basic profile.

2. Share Your Profile
Copy our personality prompt → Paste into ChatGPT → Get your
authentic profile → Share the link with us. You control what
we see.

3. Get Matched & Connect
We analyze compatibility between you and others in your
category. When there's strong compatibility + mutual interest,
we connect you. Skip the performance, start with real conversations.

Subject: Welcome to Authentyc [#234 on the waitlist]

Hi there,

You're officially on the Authentyc waitlist (#234).

We're building a new way to match people based on authentic
compatibility—not curated profiles or rehearsed answers.

Here's what happens next:

→ We'll email you when we launch invite-only access (Q1 2026)
→ You'll get first access to [hiring/dating/founder matching]
→ We might reach out for early feedback (optional, with perks)

In the meantime, you can:
• Follow our journey on Twitter [@authentyc_ai]
• Share with friends who'd benefit from authentic matching

Questions? Just reply to this email.

— The Authentyc Team

P.S. We're testing all three categories (hiring, dating, founder
matching) to identify which provides the strongest signal. Your
category preference helps us decide which to launch first.
Hit reply if you have thoughts!

**FAQ Content:**

**Q: How does it work?**
A: You share AI conversation links (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.). We analyze communication patterns, problem-solving style, and authentic personality—then match you with compatible people. Only insights are shared, never raw conversations.

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Yes. You control what conversations you share. We encrypt all data, never sell it, and never show your raw conversations to anyone. Only structured insights (e.g., "collaborative communication style") are used for matching. You can delete your data anytime.

**Q: Which AI tools do you support?**
A: We're starting with ChatGPT (most widely used, 200M+ weekly users). Support for Claude and Gemini coming in Phase 2 based on demand.

**Q: When will this launch?**
A: We're launching invite-only in Q1 2026, starting with early waitlist members. We'll focus on the category with strongest demand first, then expand to others.

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: Pricing isn't finalized yet. For individual users (dating/founder matching), we're exploring freemium models with premium features. For companies (B2B hiring in Phase 2), expect $30K-75K/year. Early waitlist members will get founding member pricing.

**Q: Do I need to upload my entire ChatGPT history?**
A: No. We use share links—you copy our personality prompt, paste it into ChatGPT, and share just that conversation link with us. You control exactly what we see.

**Q: What if I don't have extensive ChatGPT history?**
A: The personality prompt we provide works even with limited history. ChatGPT analyzes patterns from your past conversations to generate insights. If you're brand new to ChatGPT, we can offer alternative assessment methods, though AI conversations provide the most authentic signal.

**Q: Is this actually real, or just vaporware?**
A: We're currently in validation phase. We're committed to launching only if our matching accuracy exceeds 60% (vs. ~30% for traditional methods). We're testing all three categories to identify which provides the strongest signal. Follow our journey on Twitter for transparent updates.

**Q: Can I game the system by faking "good" conversations?**
A: Creating authentic-seeming conversation patterns is harder than it looks—you'd need to consistently demonstrate problem-solving, communication style, and personality traits over time. Plus, you'd only hurt yourself with bad matches. Our analysis includes authenticity signals, and we're continuously improving detection methods.

**Q: What about privacy and AI terms of service?**
A: We only work with conversation data that users explicitly consent to share. We're building partnerships with AI providers to ensure compliance. Users always own their data.

```

### Supabase Setup

**Table Schema:**
```sql
-- Waitlist leads
CREATE TABLE waitlist_leads (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  primary_interest TEXT NOT NULL,
  other_interest_detail TEXT,
  has_ai_history TEXT,
  source TEXT,
  utm_source TEXT,
  utm_medium TEXT,
  utm_campaign TEXT,
  referrer TEXT,
  user_agent TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'new',
  notes TEXT
);

-- Index for querying
CREATE INDEX idx_waitlist_created ON waitlist_leads(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_waitlist_status ON waitlist_leads(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_waitlist_interest ON waitlist_leads(primary_interest);

-- Row Level Security (optional for now)
ALTER TABLE waitlist_leads ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Service role can do everything (for API)
CREATE POLICY "Service role full access" ON waitlist_leads
  FOR ALL USING (auth.role() = 'service_role');
```

### API Route: `/api/waitlist/route.ts`

```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';
import { z } from 'zod';

    const referrer = request.headers.get('referer');
    const user_agent = request.headers.get('user-agent');

    // Insert into database
    const { data: lead, error } = await supabase
      .from('waitlist_leads')
      .insert({
        ...data,
        source: utm_source || 'direct',
        utm_source,
        utm_medium,

        );
      }
      throw error;
    }

    // Send welcome email via Resend
    if (process.env.RESEND_API_KEY) {

  return `
    <h1>Welcome to Authentyc</h1>
    <p>You're officially on the waitlist for ${interest}.</p>
    <!-- Full email template here -->
  `;
}
```

### Analytics Implementation

**PostHog Events to Track:**
```typescript
// Page view (automatic)
posthog.capture('$pageview');

// Scroll depth
posthog.capture('scroll_depth', { depth: '50%' });
posthog.capture('scroll_depth', { depth: '100%' });

// Section visibility
posthog.capture('viewed_section', { section: 'how_it_works' });

// Card clicks
posthog.capture('category_card_clicked', {
  category: 'hiring' | 'dating' | 'founders'
});

// Form interactions
posthog.capture('waitlist_form_opened');
posthog.capture('waitlist_form_submitted', {
  category: 'hiring',
  has_ai_history: 'extensive',
});

// CTA clicks
posthog.capture('cta_clicked', {
  location: 'hero' | 'category_card' | 'footer',
  text: 'Get Early Access',
});
```

## Content for Launch Posts

### Product Hunt Launch

**Tagline**: "Match people by who they really are, not who they claim to be"

**Description**:
```
Authentyc analyzes AI conversation patterns to reveal authentic
compatibility for hiring, dating, and team building.

The Problem:
• Resumes exaggerate skills
• Dating profiles perform
• Interviews are rehearsed
• You waste time on bad matches

Our Solution:
We analyze how people actually communicate in their private AI
conversations (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to reveal:
• Real problem-solving patterns
• Authentic communication style
• Emotional intelligence
• True values & priorities

Then we match you with compatible people—whether you're hiring,
dating, or building a team.

We're launching invite-only in Q1 2026. Join the waitlist to get
early access.
```

**First Comment (from founder):**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name], founder of Authentyc.

I built this because I was frustrated with how much performance
goes into traditional matching—whether hiring, dating, or finding
co-founders. Everyone curates their best self.

But when people use ChatGPT/Claude, they drop the act. They ask
real questions. They work through real problems. They reveal how
they actually think.

What if we could use that authentic signal for matching?

We're still validating the hypothesis (transparency: this might
not work!). But early tests with 50+ people show promising results.

Happy to answer any questions!
```

---

### Hacker News Post

**Title**: "Show HN: Authentyc – Match people based on AI conversation patterns"

**Post**:
```
Hi HN,

I'm working on Authentyc (https://authentyc.ai), which analyzes
people's ChatGPT/Claude conversation histories to reveal authentic
personality and capability—then matches them for hiring, dating,
or team building.

The hypothesis: People are more authentic when problem-solving with
AI than when writing resumes or dating profiles. If we can extract
that signal, we can make better matches.

We're currently in validation phase:
• 50+ early testers
• Testing across hiring, founder matching, and dating
• Aiming for >60% prediction accuracy (vs ~30% baseline)

I'd love feedback from HN:
1. Does this seem like valuable signal or just noise?
2. Would you share your AI conversations for better matches?
3. What concerns would you have about privacy/gaming?

Landing page is live (waitlist only for now). No product yet—
genuinely trying to validate before building.

Transparent updates on Twitter: @authentyc_ai

Happy to answer questions!
```

### Twitter Launch Thread

```
1/ Launching Authentyc today 🎉

What if you could see how someone really thinks, communicates,
and solves problems—before you hire them, date them, or start
a company with them?

That's what we're building.

https://authentyc.ai

🧵

2/ The problem: Everyone performs.

→ Resumes exaggerate
→ Dating profiles curate
→ Interviews rehearse

You waste time/money/emotions on mismatches you could have avoided.

3/ Our insight: People are more authentic with AI.

When someone uses ChatGPT to debug code, plan a project, or think
through a problem—they're not performing. They're thinking.

That's the real signal.

4/ We analyze AI conversation patterns to reveal:

✓ Real problem-solving ability
✓ Communication clarity
✓ Emotional intelligence
✓ Learning velocity
✓ Collaboration style

Then we match you with compatible people.

5/ Use cases:

💼 Hiring – Find talent who can actually do the job
❤️ Dating – Find someone you actually vibe with
🚀 Teams – Find co-founders/masterminds that fit

Which one interests you most?

6/ We're launching invite-only in Q1 2026.

We're testing all three categories (hiring, dating, founder
matching) to identify which provides the strongest signal.

Join the waitlist: https://authentyc.ai

Follow along as we build in public: @authentyc_ai

RT if you think this could change how we match people 🚀

## Budget Estimate

**Domain**: $12/year (Namecheap)
**Vercel**: $0 (Hobby tier sufficient)
**Supabase**: $0 (Free tier sufficient for <10K leads)
**Resend**: $0 (Free tier: 3K emails/month)
**PostHog**: $0 (Free tier: 1M events/month)
**Design tools**: $0 (use Figma free tier if needed)

**Total MVP run-rate**: ~$12/year until you need to scale

---

## Questions to Answer Before Building

1. **Domain**: Do you own authentyc.ai? If not, buy it now ($1K-5K)
2. **Founder email**: What email for "from" address? (hello@, founders@, hi@?)
3. **Social handles**: Secure @authentyc_ai on Twitter/LinkedIn
4. **ToS/Privacy**: Use template or hire lawyer? (template fine for MVP)
5. **Analytics**: PostHog vs Mixpanel vs plain Vercel Analytics?
6. **Color scheme**: Approve the blue/red palette or want different?
7. **Logo**: Design custom or use text logo initially?

---

## Ready to Build?

Once you approve this plan, I can:
1. Generate the actual Next.js code
2. Write the Supabase migrations
3. Create the email templates
4. Draft the launch posts

**What's the first thing you want me to build?**
