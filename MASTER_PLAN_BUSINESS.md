# Master Plan: Authentyc.AI - Revealing Authentic Personalities from ChatGPT History

## Vision & End Goal
Build the world's leading AI-powered personality insights platform by analyzing ChatGPT conversation histories. Transform high-stakes decisions in hiring, security clearance, team formation, and leadership development.

**End Goal**: B2B market dominance, optional B2G
- **B2B**: Enterprise talent assessment, executive recruiting ($500B+ TAM)
- **B2G**: Security clearance evaluation, government hiring ($50B+ market) - long-term only

## The Opportunity
**Problem**: Modern profiles are curated fiction. Resumes, dating bios, and interviews are all performative. Truth hides in ChatGPT chats where people reveal authentic thinking.

**Solution**: Analyze candidates' authentic AI conversation histories (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to reveal:
- Cognitive patterns & problem-solving approach
- Communication style & authenticity
- Values, priorities, and technical depth
- Leadership potential

**Start with ChatGPT. Why?** 80% marketshare, 200M+ weekly users, humanity's most candid mirror.

**Example Prompt (user)**: "Based on everything you know about me from our past chats, please describe my personality, intelligence, and communication style as objectively and as detailed as possible."

**Example Prompt (server)**: "Analyze compatibility between Person A and Person B for romantic relationship potential. Be objective and evidence-based. <Person A copy-pasted output> <Person B copy-pasted output>"

## Strategy: Multi-Category Testing → B2B → (Maybe) B2G

### Phase 1: Multi-Category Validation (Months 1-12)
**Goal**: Test all three categories, identify strongest segment, validate technology
- Launch Authentyc with three tracks: Dating, Hiring / Job Seeking, and Founder Matching
- Collect waitlist signups across all categories to gauge demand
- Pick the category with strongest interest (>40% of signups) and best engagement metrics
- Target: 500-1K active users in winning category, 60%+ satisfaction, case studies

**Success Gate**: Clear category winner + 60%+ prediction accuracy + credible case studies

### Phase 2: B2B Enterprise (Months 13-24+) ← PRIMARY FOCUS
**Goal**: $500K-5M ARR from enterprise hiring (conservative target)
- Launch TalentSignal for recruiting/talent assessment
- Target: Tech companies, executive search, HR platforms
- Pricing: $30K-75K annual contracts
- Use cases: Technical hiring, executive assessment, team compatibility
- Leverage Phase 1 data and case studies for credibility

**Revenue**: $500K-2M ARR initially → $5M-10M at scale

### Phase 3: Three Possible Paths

**Decision at $3M B2B ARR**:
- Path A: Scale B2B to $10M-20M ARR (safest, recommended)
- Path B: Pursue B2G (highest risk/reward)
- Path C: Exit via acquisition

## Brand Architecture
- **Authentyc**: Primary brand for Phase 1 multi-category testing
- **Phase 1 Categories**: Dating, Hiring / Job seeking, Founder Matching (equal weighting)
- **TalentSignal**: B2B hiring product (Phase 2, primary revenue driver)
- **ClearanceIQ**: B2G product (Phase 3, only if pursued)

## Market Economics
| Market | TAM | ARPU | Our Focus |
|--------|-----|------|-----------|
| Consumer (Dating/Founder) | $5B | $10-30/mo | Phase 1 validation |
| Enterprise Hiring | $500B+ | $30K-75K/yr | **Phase 2 PRIMARY** |
| Government | $50B+ | $1M-10M/contract | Phase 3 (conditional) |

## OpenAI Partnership Strategy

### Approach: Build Without Permission First
- Use public share links (not API abuse)
- Prove concept before asking for partnership

### When to Contact OpenAI
**DON'T contact until**: 500+ active users, press coverage, AND clear traction in winning category
**Ideal timing**: 1K+ users, strong engagement metrics, Month 9-15

### What to Prepare
1. **Traction package**: User metrics, success stories, press, growth charts
2. **Value prop for OpenAI**: "We drive ChatGPT Plus subscriptions, expand enterprise use cases"
3. **Partnership options**:
   - **Option A (Minimal)**: "Don't block us" + credit ChatGPT
   - **Option B (API)**: Formal API access + 5-10% revenue share
   - **Option C (Strategic)**: Deep integration + 20-30% revenue share

### How to Contact
**Best**: Warm intro via tier-1 VC (a16z, Sequoia) or YC
**Alternative**: Press-driven inbound, partnerships@openai.com (5% response)

### Timeline
```
Month 1-6: Build without permission
Month 7-12: Reach 1K+ users, prepare materials
Month 13-18: First contact (Option A)
Month 19-24: Formalize or deploy multi-LLM backup
```

## User Flows

### CRITICAL: Two Different Flows

**Landing Page Flow (What We ADVERTISE - Pre-Launch Waitlist)**:
```
1. Browse landing page → Learn about product
2. Click "Get Early Access" → Enter email + select interests
3. Join waitlist → Receive confirmation
4. Wait for invite (Q1 2026)
```
*Simple, straightforward, honest. No mention of the psychological hooks.*

**Product Flow (What We BUILD - Actual App Experience)**:
```
1. User lands on app → Sees enticing preview of potential matches
2. Browse/swipe through 5 potential matches (no login required)
   - For Dating: See attractive profiles, interesting bios
   - For Hiring: See relevant job postings or candidates
   - For Co-Founder: See potential founding partners with complementary skills
3. After ~5 swipes → "Want to see your compatibility scores?"
4. Paywall appears → Must create profile to continue
5. User thinks: "Well, I already invested time swiping 5 matches..."
6. Create profile: name, photo, basic info
7. Copy personality prompt → Paste in ChatGPT → Get analysis
8. Share ChatGPT link with us
9. Consent screen → Submit share link
10. We analyze and show compatibility summary with those 5 matches they swiped
11. From now on: Each swipe shows real-time LLM compatibility analysis
```

**Why This Works (Psychological Hook)**:
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: After 5 swipes, users feel invested and don't want to "waste" their time
- **Curiosity Gap**: "I already saw these 5 people... I NEED to know our compatibility"
- **Gradual Commitment**: Browse → Swipe → Create Profile → Share Data (small steps)
- **Social Proof**: Seeing real matches first proves the concept before asking for data

**Important**: NEVER advertise the swipe-first trick. Landing page should position as simple "sign up → share data → get matches" flow. The psychological hook is a product feature, not a marketing message.

**Cold Start Solution (Initial Match Seeding)**:
To enable the swipe-first experience from day 1, you need pre-populated profiles: Recruit 20-30 early users per category before public launch, get their ChatGPT profiles, use them as initial match pool. New users see these seeded profiles for their first 5 swipes, then graduate to the real user pool once they submit their own profile.

### Phase 2 - B2B Hiring (TalentSignal)

**Recruiters**: Company setup → Post roles → Access candidate compatibility scores
**Candidates**: Share link + job preferences → Get matched to compatible roles

## Success Metrics (Phase-Gated)

### Phase 1: Multi-Category Validation (Months 1-12)
- **Month 1**: 100+ waitlist signups across all categories
- **Month 3**: 300+ signups, clear category leader (>40% of signups)
- **Month 6**: 500+ active users in winning category, 60%+ satisfaction
- **Month 12**: 1K+ users, 100+ successful matches/placements, 5+ case studies
- **Gate**: 60%+ prediction accuracy + clear category winner before B2B

### Phase 2: B2B (Months 13-24)
- **Early**: 30+ qualified leads, 3-5 pilot customers ($30K-50K each), 2+ case studies
- **Scale**: $500K-1M ARR Year 1, $2M-3M ARR Year 2, <15% churn
- **Gate at $3M ARR**: Choose Path A/B/C

### Phase 3: The Three Paths
TBD

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| OpenAI blocks scraping | Build first with user leverage; backup: Claude/Gemini adapters |
| Privacy backlash | Extreme transparency, user control, consent-first |
| Discrimination lawsuits | EEOC compliance, disparate impact testing, "supplemental only" |
| Can't reach B2B | Separate brands; survey at month 6; treat consumer as R&D if needed |
| Competitors copy | Move fast, network effects, enterprise integrations |
| Ethical concerns | Ethics board, use case limits, refuse unethical contracts |

## Development Timeline (Concierge MVP)

**Sprint 0 (Week 0-1)**: Landing page (ADVERTISE flow), waitlist, manual outreach to 10-15 testers
**Sprint 1 (Week 2-3)**: Share link submission, manual analysis emails to 20 testers, seed initial profiles
**Sprint 2 (Week 4-5)**: Swipe preview (BUILD flow), concierge matching, track engagement
**Sprint 3 (Week 6-7)**: Automate proven steps, profile management, pick strongest segment

**Note**: Sprint 0 builds the landing page with simple "sign up → get matched" messaging. Sprint 2 builds the actual app with swipe-first psychological hooks. These are intentionally different.

## Legal & Privacy (MVP)
- **User warrants**: Right to share, no third-party private info, consent to analysis
- **Company disclaims**: Prediction accuracy, hiring/dating liability, content responsibility
- **Data captured**: Email, profile, share link HTML (30-day retention), extracted traits
- **Operations**: Manual deletion/export (<7 days turnaround)
- **Employment disclaimer**: "Supplemental only, comply with EEOC/ADA, no protected characteristics"

## Future Features (Post-MVP)
**Phase 2**: Friendship mode, ATS integration (Greenhouse/Lever), multiple prompt analysis, mobile apps
**Phase 3**: LLM fine-tuning, real-time matching, advanced filters, LinkedIn/GitHub integration

## Exit Scenarios (3-5 Years)
- **Conservative**: $5M-10M B2B ARR → Exit at $50M-150M (HR tech acquisition)
- **Moderate**: $10M-20M B2B ARR → Exit at $100M-250M (strategic acquisition)
- **Ambitious**: $20M-30M mixed ARR → Exit at $200M-400M or remain independent

**Acquirers**: Workday, Oracle, LinkedIn, Greenhouse, Lever (B2B) | Booz Allen, SAIC (B2G)

## Open Questions

**Product**: Domain names? Prevent fake conversations? Multi-LLM support timing?
**B2B**: Which segments first (tech/search/platforms)? Pricing model (per-candidate/seat/usage)?

## Why This Works
1. De-risk tech in consumer before enterprise
2. Build data moat (10K profiles = B2B training data)
3. Generate credibility (press, case studies) for B2B sales
4. Focus on achievable B2B, preserve B2G optionality
5. Avoid premature compliance investment
6. First-mover advantage (12-24 month head start)
