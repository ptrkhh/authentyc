# Master Plan: Authentyc.AI - Revealing Authentic Personalities from ChatGPT History

## Vision & End Goal

Build the **authenticity layer for conversational AI** — the infrastructure that verifies genuine human personality and thought patterns in an AI-saturated world.

We're not building another insights tool. We're building the **protocol for verified conversational identity** by analyzing how people authentically think, communicate, and solve problems through their AI conversation histories.

**End Goal**: Become the standard for conversational authenticity verification
- **B2B Primary**: Enterprise talent assessment, executive recruiting ($500B+ TAM)
- **Platform Play**: API/SDK for HR platforms, dating apps, team formation tools (long-term)
- **B2G Optional**: Security clearance evaluation, government hiring ($50B+ market) - long-term only

**Think**: OpenAI is the intelligence layer. Stripe is the payments layer. **Authentyc is the authenticity layer.**

## Operations Strategy: Indonesia-Based, Globally-Focused

### The Arbitrage Advantage

**Where We Build**: Indonesia (engineering, operations, legal entity)
**Who We Serve**: Global markets (US, Europe, Asia-Pacific)
**Result**: Global product quality at Indonesian cost structure

### Why This Works

**Cost Advantage (40-60% capital efficiency)**:
- Indonesian senior engineers: $30K-50K/year vs $150K-200K in US
- Operations costs: 3-5x cheaper (office, legal, HR, infrastructure)
- **Same revenue targets, 40-60% less capital required**
- Extended runway: 24-36 months on $5M vs 18-24 months for US-based startups

**Global Market Access**:
- Product indistinguishable from US/EU startups (English-first, world-class quality)
- Global pricing maintained: $30K-75K enterprise contracts, $10-30/mo consumer
- US entity for customer contracts and fundraising (see MASTER_PLAN_LEGAL.md)
- Payment processing in USD via Stripe/standard processors

**Investor Narrative Enhancement**:
> "We achieve the same milestones as US competitors with 40-60% less capital. Same TAM, same pricing, better unit economics."

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Product Quality**: Must be indistinguishable from top-tier US startups
2. **Legal Structure**: US entity (Delaware C-Corp) + Indonesian PT (see MASTER_PLAN_LEGAL.md)
3. **Timezone Management**: Sales team coverage for US business hours
4. **Team Composition**:
   - Core engineering: Indonesia-based (cost advantage)
   - Sales/partnerships: US hours coverage (remote or US-based as revenue grows)
   - Leadership: Flexible timezone management

### What Customers See

**They experience**: World-class product, US-standard support, global brand
**They don't know/care**: Team is Indonesia-based (unless we choose to highlight cost efficiency)
**Position as**: "Global company" not "Indonesian startup"

## The Opportunity

**The Problem**: We've entered the era of AI-saturated identity. Every profile is performative. Every resume is polished. Every interview is rehearsed. Meanwhile, AI-generated content makes distinguishing real humans from synthetic personas nearly impossible. Modern profiles are curated fiction — resumes, dating bios, and interviews are all performative. Truth hides in ChatGPT chats where people reveal authentic thinking.

**The Insight**: Truth hides where people think no one is watching — their private AI conversations. ChatGPT has become humanity's most candid mirror: 200M+ weekly users revealing authentic thinking patterns, problem-solving approaches, values, and communication styles.

**The Solution**: Build the **infrastructure for conversational authenticity** — a verification layer that proves genuine human personality based on AI conversation patterns.

We analyze candidates' authentic AI conversation histories (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to reveal:
- Cognitive patterns & problem-solving approach
- Communication style & authenticity
- Values, priorities, and technical depth
- Leadership potential & interpersonal dynamics

**Why This Creates a Defensible Moat**:
- Every verified profile = training data that improves our models
- Every integration = network effects (candidates want to be where employers are)
- Every conversation analyzed = proprietary dataset competitors can't replicate
- First-mover advantage in a greenfield category

**Start with ChatGPT. Why?** 80% marketshare, 200M+ weekly users, humanity's most candid mirror.

**Multi-LLM Roadmap**: Launch with ChatGPT (Phase 1), market Claude + Gemini support as "coming soon" to signal platform ambitions. Full multi-LLM support in Phase 2b/3 establishes us as the cross-platform authenticity layer, not an OpenAI-dependent tool.

**Example Prompt (user)**: "Based on everything you know about me from our past chats, please describe my personality, intelligence, and communication style as objectively and as detailed as possible."

**Example Prompt (server)**: "Analyze compatibility between Person A and Person B for romantic relationship potential. Be objective and evidence-based. <Person A copy-pasted output> <Person B copy-pasted output>"

## Positioning: Infrastructure, Not Just Product

### What We're NOT Building
- ❌ Another personality test (Myers-Briggs, Big Five, etc.)
- ❌ A dating app with AI features
- ❌ An ATS plugin or recruiting tool
- ❌ A one-time assessment product

### What We ARE Building
- ✅ **The authenticity protocol** for conversational AI era
- ✅ **A new data class**: verified conversational identity
- ✅ **Infrastructure for trust** in an AI-saturated world
- ✅ **The verification layer** between humans and high-stakes decisions

### Competitive Positioning

| Category | Example | Why We're Different |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| Personality Tests | Myers-Briggs, Big Five, CliftonStrengths | Self-reported (gameable) vs. behavioral proof |
| HR Tech | Workday, Greenhouse, Lever | We're data infrastructure they integrate, not competitor |
| Background Checks | Checkr, HireRight | We verify *who you are*, they verify *what you claim* |
| Dating Apps | Hinge, Bumble, Match | We're the verification layer, not the marketplace |

### Investor Narrative

> "In a world full of AI-generated content and performative personas, Authentyc provides a **proof-of-human authenticity layer**. We're not building features—we're building the trust infrastructure for verified conversational identity. Think OpenAI for intelligence, Stripe for payments, **Authentyc for authenticity**."

## Strategy: Multi-Category Testing → B2B SaaS → Platform API

### Phase 1: Multi-Category Validation (Months 1-12)
**Goal**: Test all three categories, identify strongest segment, validate technology
- Launch Authentyc with three tracks: Dating, Hiring / Job Seeking, and Founder Matching
- Collect waitlist signups across all categories to gauge demand
- Pick the category with strongest interest (>40% of signups) and best engagement metrics
- Target: 500-1K active users in winning category, 60%+ satisfaction, case studies

**Success Gate**: Clear category winner + 60%+ prediction accuracy + credible case studies

### Phase 2: B2B Enterprise SaaS (Months 13-24+) ← PRIMARY FOCUS
**Goal**: $500K-5M ARR from enterprise hiring (conservative target)
- Launch TalentSignal for recruiting/talent assessment
- Target: Tech companies, executive search, HR platforms
- Pricing: $30K-75K annual contracts
- Use cases: Technical hiring, executive assessment, team compatibility
- Leverage Phase 1 data and case studies for credibility

**Revenue**: $500K-2M ARR initially → $5M-10M at scale

**Focus**: Prove SaaS value proposition before adding API complexity

### Phase 2b/3: Platform API Layer (After $2M ARR)
**Goal**: Layer in platform revenue stream once SaaS is proven
- Launch Authentyc API for platform integrations
- Target: ATS platforms (Greenhouse, Lever), dating apps, team formation tools
- Pricing: $0.50-5 per verification (usage-based)
- Use cases: Third-party apps embedding authenticity verification

**Strategy**: Lead with SaaS to prove value, layer in API as credibility builds. API partnerships create flywheel—more platforms = more users = better data = better SaaS product.

**Revenue Evolution**:
- **Phase 2 (Months 13-24)**: 95% SaaS, 5% pilot API partnerships
- **Phase 2b (Months 25-36)**: 80% SaaS, 20% API licensing
- **Phase 3 (Years 3-5)**: 70% SaaS, 30% API as integrations scale

### Phase 3: Three Possible Paths

**Decision at $3M B2B ARR**:
- Path A: Scale B2B to $10M-20M ARR (safest, recommended)
- Path B: Pursue B2G (highest risk/reward)
- Path C: Exit via acquisition

## Brand Architecture

- **Authentyc**: Primary brand for Phase 1 multi-category testing
- **Phase 1 Categories**: Dating, Hiring / Job seeking, Founder Matching (equal weighting)
- **TalentSignal**: B2B hiring product (Phase 2, primary revenue driver)
- **ClearanceIQ**: B2G product (Phase 3, only if pursued)

## Market Economics & Revenue Model

| Market | TAM | Revenue Model | Our Focus |
|--------|-----|---------------|-----------|
| Consumer (Dating/Founder) | $5B | $10-30/mo subscriptions | Phase 1 validation |
| Enterprise Hiring (SaaS) | $500B+ | $30K-75K/yr contracts | **Phase 2 PRIMARY** |
| Platform/API Licensing | $50B+ | $0.50-5 per verification | **Phase 2b/3 SECONDARY** |
| Government | $50B+ | $1M-10M/contract | Phase 3 (conditional) |

### Sequential Revenue Strategy

**Phase 1**: SaaS-first approach
- **100% focus**: Direct enterprise sales, $30K-75K annual contracts
- **Pilot API**: 1-2 strategic partnerships to validate model (<5% revenue)

**Phase 2**: Layer in API once SaaS proven ($2M+ ARR)
- **80% SaaS contracts**: Proven enterprise sales motion
- **20% API licensing**: Usage-based pricing for platforms
  - Tier 1: $0.50/verification (high volume: 10K+/mo)
  - Tier 2: $2/verification (medium: 1K-10K/mo)
  - Tier 3: $5/verification (low: <1K/mo)

**Phase 3**: Platform revenue may match or exceed SaaS as integrations scale

## OpenAI Partnership Strategy

### Approach: Build Without Permission First
- Use public share links (not API abuse)
- Prove concept before asking for partnership
- Market multi-LLM support (Claude, Gemini) as "coming soon" from day 1 to position as platform, not OpenAI dependency

### When to Contact OpenAI
**DON'T contact until**: 500+ active users, press coverage, AND clear traction in winning category
**Ideal timing**: 1K+ users, strong engagement metrics, Month 9-15

### What to Prepare
1. **Traction package**: User metrics, success stories, press, growth charts
2. **Value prop for OpenAI**: "We drive ChatGPT Plus subscriptions, expand enterprise use cases"
3. **Partnership options**:
   - **Option A (Minimal)**: "Don't block us" + credit ChatGPT
   - **Option B (API)**: Formal API access + 5-10% revenue share
   - **Option C (Strategic)**: Deep integration + 20-30% revenue share

### How to Contact
**Best**: Warm intro via tier-1 VC (a16z, Sequoia) or YC
**Alternative**: Press-driven inbound, partnerships@openai.com (5% response)

### Timeline
```
Month 1-6: Build without permission
Month 7-12: Reach 1K+ users, prepare materials
Month 13-18: First contact (Option A)
Month 19-24: Formalize or deploy multi-LLM backup
```

## User Flows

### CRITICAL: Two Different Flows

**Landing Page Flow (What We ADVERTISE - Pre-Launch Waitlist)**:
```
1. Browse landing page → Learn about product
2. Click "Get Early Access" → Enter email + select interests
3. Join waitlist → Receive confirmation
4. Wait for invite (Q1 2026)
```
*Simple, straightforward, honest. No mention of the psychological hooks.*

**Product Flow (What We BUILD - Actual App Experience)**:
```
1. User lands on app → Sees enticing preview of potential matches
2. Browse/swipe through 5 potential matches (no login required)
   - For Dating: See attractive profiles, interesting bios
   - For Hiring: See relevant job postings or candidates
   - For Co-Founder: See potential founding partners with complementary skills
3. After ~5 swipes → "Want to see your compatibility scores?"
4. Paywall appears → Must create profile to continue
5. User thinks: "Well, I already invested time swiping 5 matches..."
6. Create profile: name, photo, basic info
7. Copy personality prompt → Paste in ChatGPT → Get analysis
8. Share ChatGPT link with us
9. Consent screen → Submit share link
10. We analyze and show compatibility summary with those 5 matches they swiped
11. From now on: Each swipe shows real-time LLM compatibility analysis
```

**Why This Works (Psychological Hook)**:
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy**: After 5 swipes, users feel invested and don't want to "waste" their time
- **Curiosity Gap**: "I already saw these 5 people... I NEED to know our compatibility"
- **Gradual Commitment**: Browse → Swipe → Create Profile → Share Data (small steps)
- **Social Proof**: Seeing real matches first proves the concept before asking for data

**Important**: NEVER advertise the swipe-first trick. Landing page should position as simple "sign up → share data → get matches" flow. The psychological hook is a product feature, not a marketing message.

**Cold Start Solution (Initial Match Seeding)**:
To enable the swipe-first experience from day 1, you need pre-populated profiles: Recruit 20-30 early users per category before public launch, get their ChatGPT profiles, use them as initial match pool. New users see these seeded profiles for their first 5 swipes, then graduate to the real user pool once they submit their own profile.

---

### Phase 2 - B2B Hiring (TalentSignal)

**Recruiters**: Company setup → Post roles → Access candidate compatibility scores
**Candidates**: Share link + job preferences → Get matched to compatible roles

## Success Metrics (Phase-Gated)

### Phase 1: Multi-Category Validation (Months 1-12)
- **Month 1**: 100+ waitlist signups across all categories
- **Month 3**: 300+ signups, clear category leader (>40% of signups)
- **Month 6**: 500+ active users in winning category, 60%+ satisfaction
- **Month 12**: 1K+ users, 100+ successful matches/placements, 5+ case studies
- **Gate**: 60%+ prediction accuracy + clear category winner before B2B

### Phase 2: B2B SaaS (Months 13-24)
- **Early**: 30+ qualified leads, 3-5 pilot customers ($30K-50K each), 2+ case studies
- **Scale**: $500K-1M ARR Year 1, $2M-3M ARR Year 2, <15% churn
- **Gate at $2M ARR**: Begin API/platform development (Phase 2b)
- **Gate at $3M ARR**: Choose Path A/B/C

### Phase 2b/3: Platform API (Months 25+)
- **Early**: 3-5 API integration partners, 1K+ API verifications/month
- **Scale**: 10+ integrations, API revenue reaches 20-30% of total ARR
- **Network effects**: Candidate cross-pollination between platforms

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| OpenAI blocks scraping | Market multi-LLM from day 1 ("coming soon"); build Claude/Gemini adapters in Phase 2b; user leverage (1K+ users) before formal contact |
| Privacy backlash | Extreme transparency, user control, consent-first |
| Discrimination lawsuits | EEOC compliance, disparate impact testing, "supplemental only" |
| Can't reach B2B | Separate brands; survey at month 6; treat consumer as R&D if needed |
| Competitors copy | Move fast, network effects, enterprise integrations, proprietary data moat |
| Ethical concerns | Ethics board, use case limits, refuse unethical contracts |
| API complexity distracts from SaaS | Delay API until $2M ARR proven, start with 1-2 pilot partners only |
| **Indonesia-based perceived as "lower quality"** | **Never mention location in marketing; product must be world-class; position as "global company"; use US entity for contracts** |
| **Cross-border legal complexity** | **Engage cross-border tax/legal counsel early (Month 1); set up US entity by Month 6-9; see MASTER_PLAN_LEGAL.md** |
| **Timezone challenges for US sales** | **Hire sales team comfortable with US hours; use async communication; founder covers US hours during early stage** |
| **Payment processing issues** | **Use Stripe via US entity; maintain USD pricing; handle forex internally** |
| **US customers won't contract with Indonesian entity** | **Use US Delaware C-Corp for all customer contracts; Indonesian PT is operational entity only** |
| **Talent retention in Indonesia** | **Offer equity (via US entity stock options); competitive local salaries (top 10%); remote-first culture; global mission** |

## Development Timeline (Concierge MVP)

**Sprint 0 (Week 0-1)**: Landing page (ADVERTISE flow), waitlist, manual outreach to 10-15 testers
**Sprint 1 (Week 2-3)**: Share link submission, manual analysis emails to 20 testers, seed initial profiles
**Sprint 2 (Week 4-5)**: Swipe preview (BUILD flow), concierge matching, track engagement
**Sprint 3 (Week 6-7)**: Automate proven steps, profile management, pick strongest segment

**Note**: Sprint 0 builds the landing page with simple "sign up → get matched" messaging. Sprint 2 builds the actual app with swipe-first psychological hooks. These are intentionally different.

## Legal & Privacy (MVP)

- **User warrants**: Right to share, no third-party private info, consent to analysis
- **Company disclaims**: Prediction accuracy, hiring/dating liability, content responsibility
- **Data captured**: Email, profile, share link HTML (30-day retention), extracted traits
- **Operations**: Manual deletion/export (<7 days turnaround)
- **Employment disclaimer**: "Supplemental only, comply with EEOC/ADA, no protected characteristics"

## Future Features (Post-MVP)

**Phase 2**:
- Product: Friendship mode, ATS integration (Greenhouse/Lever), multiple prompt analysis, mobile apps
- Multi-LLM: Claude + Gemini support (move from "coming soon" to live)

**Phase 2b**:
- Platform: API/SDK launch, developer documentation, first 3-5 integration partnerships
- White-label: Explore licensing model for enterprise customers

**Phase 3**:
- Advanced: LLM fine-tuning, real-time matching, advanced filters, LinkedIn/GitHub integration
- Scale: Full platform model with 10+ integrations, white-label licensing

## Fundraising Strategy

### Two-Path Approach

**Path A: Bootstrap → Regional → US VCs** (Recommended for capital efficiency)
1. **Phase 1 (Months 1-12)**: Bootstrap on $30K-50K personal capital
   - Build MVP with 2-3 Indonesian engineers ($10K-15K/month burn)
   - Reach 500-1K users, prove product-market fit
   - Cost: $120K-180K to reach initial traction
2. **Phase 2 (Months 13-18)**: Raise $1M-2M from SEA investors
   - Investors: East Ventures, Alpha JWC, Surge, 500 Global Indonesia
   - Use to reach $500K ARR
   - 18-24 month runway at $50K-80K/month burn
3. **Phase 3 (Months 19-24)**: Series A from US VCs ($5M-10M)
   - Proven traction: $500K-1M ARR
   - Enter with stronger negotiating position
   - Use US entity for Delaware C-Corp structure

**Path B: US VCs from Start** (Higher dilution, faster scale)
1. **Bootstrap to traction** (Months 1-9): Reach 500-1K users on personal capital
2. **Seed round** (Month 10-12): Raise $5M-10M from US VCs
   - Pitch: "Same milestones, 40-60% less capital due to Indonesia cost base"
   - 24-36 month runway vs 18-24 for US-based competitors
   - Must have US entity established (Delaware C-Corp)

### Target: $5M-10M Seed Round (Path B) or $1M-2M (Path A)

**Why Path A is recommended**:
- Less dilution in early stages (give up 15-20% vs 20-30% for seed)
- Prove model before high valuations matter
- SEA investors understand Indonesia cost advantage
- Can still access US VCs for Series A with proven traction

**Why Path B works**:
- Faster scale if you have strong network/traction
- Access to better-connected investors early
- Immediate credibility from tier-1 VCs
- Better for competitive/fast-moving markets

### Use of Funds (Indonesia-Based Operations)

**Based on $5M raise (Path B)**:
- **Monthly burn: $120K-150K** (vs $300K-400K for US-based startup)
- **Runway: 30-36 months** (vs 18-24 months)

**Allocation**:
- **Product/Engineering** (50% / $2.5M):
  - 12-15 Indonesian engineers @ $30K-50K/year = $450K-750K/year
  - Engineering infrastructure, tools, SaaS subscriptions = $100K/year
  - 3+ year runway on engineering
- **Sales/GTM** (25% / $1.25M):
  - 2-3 sales reps (remote, US hours) @ $80K-120K + commission = $250K-400K/year
  - Marketing, demand gen, conferences = $100K-150K/year
  - Partnerships/BD lead = $80K-100K/year
- **Data/AI** (15% / $750K):
  - 2-3 ML engineers (Indonesia) @ $40K-60K/year = $120K-180K/year
  - Model training, API costs (OpenAI, Anthropic) = $50K-100K/year
  - Dataset curation and labeling = $30K-50K/year
- **Operations** (10% / $500K):
  - Legal (cross-border, US + Indonesia) = $50K-80K/year
  - Accounting/tax (transfer pricing, multi-entity) = $30K-50K/year
  - HR, office, infrastructure = $40K-60K/year
  - Compliance, insurance = $20K-30K/year

**Cost Comparison: Indonesia vs US-Based**

| Category | Indonesia-Based | US-Based | Savings |
|----------|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Senior Engineer | $40K-50K | $150K-200K | 70-75% |
| Sales Rep (remote) | $80K-120K | $120K-180K | 30-40% |
| ML Engineer | $50K-60K | $160K-200K | 65-70% |
| Monthly Burn (15 people) | $120K-150K | $350K-450K | 60-65% |
| Runway on $5M | 30-36 months | 11-14 months | 2-3x longer |

**Based on $1M raise (Path A - SEA investors)**:
- **Monthly burn: $50K-70K**
- **Runway: 14-20 months** (enough to reach $500K ARR)
- Allocation: 60% engineering (8-10 engineers), 20% sales (1-2 reps), 10% AI/data, 10% ops

### Timeline to Raise

**Path A (Bootstrap → SEA → US)**:
- **Month 1-6**: Bootstrap MVP, 0-200 users, personal capital
- **Month 7-12**: Reach 500-1K users, prepare fundraising materials
- **Month 13-15**: Raise $1M-2M from SEA investors (Alpha JWC, East Ventures, Surge)
- **Month 16-24**: Scale to $500K ARR
- **Month 25-27**: Raise Series A ($5M-10M) from US VCs

**Path B (Bootstrap → US Seed)**:
- **Month 1-9**: Bootstrap to 500-1K users on personal capital ($30K-50K)
- **Month 10-12**: Active fundraising from US VCs (6-8 week process)
- **Month 13**: Close $5M-10M seed, begin aggressive hiring

### Key Milestones Before Fundraising

**For SEA Seed ($1M-2M)**:
- 500+ active users
- Clear category winner identified
- Basic case studies (5-10 success stories)
- Product demo ready
- Legal structure in place (Indonesian PT minimum)

**For US Seed ($5M-10M)**:
- 1K+ active users
- 60%+ prediction accuracy with strong case studies
- Press coverage (regional tech media minimum)
- 3-5 enterprise LOIs or pilot interest
- US entity established (Delaware C-Corp)
- Clear data moat demonstrated

### Target Investor Profile

**Southeast Asia / Regional Investors (Path A - Seed $1M-2M)**:

| Investor Type | Why They Fit | Example Firms |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **SEA Tech VCs** | Understand Indonesia cost advantage + global ambitions | East Ventures, Alpha JWC, Intudo Ventures |
| **Accelerators** | Proven global scale path, mentor network | Surge (Sequoia SEA), 500 Global Indonesia, Y Combinator |
| **Regional VCs** | Bet on SEA founders building for global markets | Openspace Ventures, Vertex Ventures, Golden Gate Ventures |
| **Strategic Angels** | Ex-Gojek, Tokopedia, Sea Group founders who scaled regionally | Individual angels from unicorn exits |

**US / Global Investors (Path B - Seed $5M-10M or Series A)**:

| Investor Type | Why They Fit | Example Firms |
|---------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Future-of-Work VCs** | Understand HR tech + data moats | Bessemer, General Catalyst, Worklife Ventures |
| **Future-of-Identity Funds** | Bet on verification/trust infrastructure | a16z, Variant, SignalFire |
| **Data Infrastructure VCs** | Value proprietary datasets + network effects | Amplify, Cowboy Ventures, First Round |
| **Global VCs with SEA presence** | Understand cost advantage + global GTM | Sequoia, Lightspeed, Accel (have SEA arms) |
| **Strategic Angels** | Ex-LinkedIn, HR tech, dating founders who get the moat | Individual scouts from above firms |

**Avoid**:
- Pure consumer VCs (won't get B2B pivot)
- Pure enterprise VCs (want predictable SaaS only)
- Crypto/web3 funds (wrong narrative fit)
- Indonesia-only investors without global portfolio (limit exit options)

### Pitch Narrative (30-second version)

**For US VCs (Path B)**:
> "We're building the authenticity layer for conversational AI. In a world of performative profiles and AI-generated content, Authentyc verifies genuine human personality through private AI conversation analysis. We're starting with enterprise hiring—$500B market where traditional assessments are broken—and expanding to become the verification protocol across dating, teams, and security. We have a defensible data moat: every conversation analyzed creates proprietary training data competitors can't replicate. **We're Indonesia-based with global ambitions—same product quality, same markets, 60% better unit economics.** We're raising $5M-7M to build the SaaS + API platform and capture the category before copycats emerge."

**For SEA VCs (Path A)**:
> "We're a global SaaS company solving authenticity verification in the age of AI. Starting with enterprise hiring ($500B market), we analyze private ChatGPT conversations to reveal genuine personality—something traditional assessments can't fake. We're building from Indonesia to keep costs low while serving US/EU markets at global pricing. **$30K-75K annual contracts, but 1/3 the burn rate of US competitors.** We're raising $1M-2M to reach $500K ARR, then raising Series A from US VCs. This is the Stripe/Plaid playbook—build infrastructure that becomes the category standard."

### What Investors Need to See (Checklist)
- ✅ 500-1K active users in Phase 1
- ✅ 60%+ prediction accuracy with case studies
- ✅ 3-5 LOIs or pilot interest from enterprise customers
- ✅ Press coverage (TechCrunch, Forbes, Wired preferred)
- ✅ Clear data moat explanation (proprietary dataset size/value)
- ✅ Ethical framework (privacy-first, consent-driven, EEOC compliance)
- ✅ Technical defensibility (why LLM analysis beats self-reported tests)
- ✅ Team credibility (AI/NLP expertise OR HR/psychometrics domain knowledge)

## Exit Scenarios (5-7 Years)

### Infrastructure-Positioned Exits

- **Base Case**: $10M-15M ARR (SaaS + early API) → Exit at $200M-350M (strategic acquisition as authenticity infrastructure)
- **Strong Case**: $20M-30M ARR (SaaS + API licensing at scale) → Exit at $400M-600M (category-defining acquisition)
- **Breakout Case**: $30M-50M ARR (platform model with 10+ integrations) → Exit at $600M-800M or remain independent as authenticity standard

**Key Value Drivers**: Proprietary dataset (50K+ verified profiles), network effects, "authenticity layer" category ownership, multi-platform integrations

**Acquirers**:
- **Tier 1 (infrastructure play)**: Microsoft, LinkedIn, Workday, Oracle (acquiring the "authenticity protocol")
- **Tier 2 (strategic)**: Greenhouse, Lever, Match Group, Bumble (acquiring data moat + technology)
- **Tier 3 (B2G track)**: Booz Allen, SAIC, Palantir (if pursuing government contracts)

**Note**: These valuations assume successful execution on infrastructure narrative with proven platform traction (API partnerships, multi-LLM support, data moat). SaaS-only execution would likely result in lower multiples ($100M-300M range).

## Open Questions

**Product**:
- Domain names (authentyc.ai vs .com)?
- How to prevent fake conversations (fabricated ChatGPT exports)?
- White-label licensing timing (Phase 2b vs Phase 3)?

**B2B**:
- Which enterprise segments first (tech startups vs. executive search vs. HR platforms)?
- Pricing model validation—is $30K-75K the right range for annual contracts?

**API**:
- Pricing validation—is $0.50-5/verification the right range?
- Should we offer freemium tier for developers?
- How many pilot partnerships before full API launch?

**Fundraising**:
- Solo founder or bring on co-founder (CTO/AI scientist) before raising?
- Path A (SEA seed → US Series A) vs Path B (US seed direct)?
- Target $1M-2M (SEA) or $5M-10M (US) for initial raise?

**Legal/Operations**:
- Set up US entity immediately (Month 1) or wait until first revenue (Month 6-9)?
- Delaware C-Corp vs LLC for US entity?
- How to structure IP ownership between US and Indonesian entities?
- When to hire cross-border tax accountant? (See MASTER_PLAN_LEGAL.md)

## Why This Works

### The Data Moat Is The Business

Every conversation we analyze creates **irreplaceable proprietary data**:
- **10K verified profiles** = training dataset worth $10M+ (no competitor can buy this)
- **User consent + context** = legally defensible data advantage
- **Longitudinal patterns** = we learn what predicts success (dating, hiring, teams)
- **Network effects** = more users → better matching → more users

**This isn't a features race. It's a data accumulation race.** First to 50K profiles wins the category.

### The Strategic Path

1. **De-risk tech in consumer before enterprise** - Validate accuracy in high-frequency, low-stakes use cases first
2. **Build data moat** - 10K profiles from Phase 1 = proprietary B2B training data
3. **Generate credibility** - Press, case studies, and waitlist demand become B2B sales ammunition
4. **Focus on achievable B2B** - $500K-5M ARR is realistic; preserve platform optionality for later
5. **Avoid premature complexity** - Don't build API until SaaS is proven at $2M+ ARR
6. **Avoid premature compliance** - Don't build for government until government is buying
7. **First-mover advantage** - 12-24 month head start before copycats emerge
8. **Build infrastructure narrative, execute product** - Position as authenticity protocol, but prove value with SaaS first
